# Employee Unit History Analyzer

Welcome to the **Employee Unit History Analyzer**! This application is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of employee movement across different units within Company X. The goal is not just to create a functional application, but to showcase exceptional engineering practices, including code quality, architectural elegance, optimized data handling, and visually appealing design.

## Overview

The main objective of this project is to develop a solution that allows an admin user to upload a spreadsheet containing the list of employees who have transitioned between various units within Company X. The application will then present the following insights:

1. **Years in Each Unit**: Display the number of years each employee has spent in each unit they have been part of.

2. **Cumulative Years**: Calculate the total cumulative number of years each employee has spent in the company across all units.

3. **Graphical Representation**: Generate a graph that visually represents the number of years spent in each unit by all employees. This graph will illustrate the combined years attributed to each unit based on individual employee histories.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Spreadsheet**: Admin users can upload a spreadsheet containing employee unit history data.
   
2. **Data Processing**: The application processes the uploaded spreadsheet, extracting relevant information about employee transitions and unit durations.

3. **Analysis**: Based on the data, the application generates the required insights, including years in each unit and cumulative years.

4. **Graph Visualization**: The graph is generated to visualize the collective years spent in each unit by all employees.

## Evaluation Criteria

This project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Design and Architecture Quality**: Showcase a well-thought-out and organized architectural design that reflects best practices.

- **Code Quality**: Demonstrate clean, maintainable, and efficient code that adheres to coding standards.

- **User Experience**: Create a user-friendly and visually appealing frontend that enhances the user experience.

- **Database Migration**: Implement effective database migration strategies to manage data changes.

- **Testing**: Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of the application.

- **CI/CD**: Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment to ensure smooth development workflows.

- **Deployment**: Successfully deploy the application to a hosting environment, making it accessible for evaluation.
